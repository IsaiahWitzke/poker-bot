# SEE POKER-BOT AI FOLDER FOR MEAT & POTATOES OF PROJECT

I am bad at poker. Will make a Bot that plays it better than me.

Using this project as an intro to neural networks. Using C++ to implement the neural network described on 3Blue1Brown's channel.

Right now, the neural network is only trained on the MNIST handwritten number images - poker comes later.
