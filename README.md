# poker-bot
I am bad at poker. Will make a Bot that plays it better than me.

Using this project as an intro to neural networks. Using C++ to implement the neural network described on 3Blue1Brown's channel.

Will make sure that I implemented neural network properly by trying to classify MNIST handwritten number images.

Will then try to make a RNN or something more crazy for poker.

Will then try to get the poker bot to play against itself to train... maybe try to train the bot on previous poker game data?
